# Calendar Specific Event Types

## Requirements

-   **Configuration**: Users MUST be able to select a default Event Type for each specific calendar.
-   **Default State**: By default, no specific event type is assigned (inherits global default).
-   **Application**: When a new event is created on a specific calendar, the UI MUST pre-select the configured default event type for that calendar.
